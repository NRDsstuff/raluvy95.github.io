This technology allows for web browser to render Flash content, which contains interactive, videos and even video games. In early 2010s, Flash content was used in <strong>over 50%</strong> of all websites at that time.
Flash is well known today for its Flash games and animations. Most of them are hosted on <a href="https://newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a></p> <p>If you were on the Internet in the 2000s, you likely had an experience trying out to make Internet Explorer work with Flash Player ðŸ™‚</p> <h2>Problems</h2> <p>Since this technology is not an open standard (aka proprietary) it can lead to <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-6761/Adobe-Flash-Player.html">a lot of security issues</a>. Adobe took a lot of time to finally patch most of them, even severe which was actively used by bad actors.
If you wonder why do people use this at that time it was peak, donâ€™t blame on people because they donâ€™t have many options that works the best for them. There are open source version of this technology such as <a href="https://lightspark.github.io/">Lightspark</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">GNU Gnash</a>. None of them are closer or work best with original.
Another reason why people used it is because web technology at that time wasnâ€™t as powerful as Flash content. Remember, HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 JS werenâ€™t a thing!!! Browsing web contents wasnâ€™t possible or very limited without Flash installed.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Iâ€™m so glad Flash Player is gone, at least not in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player#Mainland_China%E2%80%93specific_variant">China</a> which is still supported. I agree that removing Flash support will finally have more secure browsingâ€¦ unless if you are trying to browse old websites with Flash content on it.
Flash games, however, deserved to keep alive without having to get Flash content. A lot of Flash games are re-exported to HTML5 games and there is a browser extension called <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> to run Flash content.</p> <p>I wish I had experience browsing Flash contents in the 2000s.</p>`,l(e,"class","markdown-body")},m(t,s){d(t,e,s)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&w(e)}}}const u={};class g extends n{constructor(e){super(),i(this,e,null,p,r,{})}}export{g as default,u as frontmatter};
