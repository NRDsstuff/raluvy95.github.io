# Education system must be reformed
There is no reason to keep current system. Seriously.

If the technology advances enough, this current system will become obsolete in near future, most likely in 2050.

School is still the most common topic in the world. Every children, teen, parent, teacher and school director have heard at least few rants about school or education system in their life. Not only the rants, but also potential solutions which will benefit for everyone. So far, no major reforms in school has been made.

Sharing your knowledge and your skill for everyone to learn is very fun, right? That's the definition of education. This is what school was meant for.

Imagine a place where people have no choice but to force to know specific information they don't want or need. People will have to follow non-democratically fixed program which may change for no reason. Every lesson is not unique at all! That must be boring right? Not to mention that useless information must **be taught** in order to pass! 
If you guessed this place as an education prison. **NO!** This is what average school around the world look like. Even in democratic countries like the West still have authoratian-like public school.

## My view on school
As an adult who will pass my 11th grade in June. I see my school as a temporarly prison place. I'm not kidding, a lot of lessons I attended so far barely have interesing part and basically just wasted my time listening to what my teacher said and write it down. Additional time wasted due to the issues not related to the lesson and as well as late teacher arrival. I geniunely wish my time would never waste in school for no reason.

Last year, we had [teacher's strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Romanian_teachers%27_strike) which gave us 3 weeks of free, just before I finish my school. It was truly amazing.


## So what's the solution?
As I said, there are so many potential solutions. The best solutions I could give are:
- Abolish homework or use it as a punishment. Just like how homework was originally used for.
- Make every lesson more interesing. I don't want to put subway surfers gameplay and satisfying videos next to the teacher. What I mean, make so children will finally enjoy it.
- Raise education budget **(IMPORTANT!)**
- Treat public school as first-class place, not a miserable place. Simply make school feel like your house.
- Vote for mayor who promise this if you are a parent or adult.
- Make the school program more flexible and democratically.
- Add important life lessons such as sex education and cooking.
- Change the policy every few months to adapt/avoid new technology such as the AI
- Abolish compulsory exams. They only make student's mental health worse. Why not make project in class?
